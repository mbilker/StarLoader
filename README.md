StarLoader
==========


What's this?

This is a dylib loader for the OpenStar Project.
It includes an hooking library, and it's pretty fast.

How to Use:

You can find an example of this in our TweetPwn repository.

Installing a precompiled version
=================================

Download http://d.pr/kHD4 and install StarLoader_INSTALLER.pkg.
Enjoy.

Building

To build StarLoader, simply move into its directory and run these commands:

	make
	make install

After this, the loader is already injected so there's no need to log out and log in anymore.

Enjoy.
