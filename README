StarLoader
==========


What's this?

This is a dylib loader for the OpenStar Project.
It includes an hooking library, and it's pretty fast.

How to Use:

You can find an example of this in our TweetPwn repository.

Building
==========
To build StarLoader, simply move into its directory and run these commands:

	make
	make install

After this, the loader is already injected so there's no need to log out and log in anymore.

Enjoy.
